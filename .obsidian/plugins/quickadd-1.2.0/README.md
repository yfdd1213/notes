# QuickAdd
QuickAdd is a powerful combination of four tools (called choices): templates, captures, macros, and multis.

A [**Template**](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/Choices/TemplateChoice) is a definition of how to create a new note, and composes with Obsidian's own Templates core plugin or community template plugins. For example, it would allow you to define a quick action to create a new note in a particular location, with a templatized title, and templated content.

A [**Capture**](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/Choices/CaptureChoice) allows you to quickly add content to predefined files. For example, you could set up a quick action to add a link to the open file to your daily note under a specific section.

[**Macros**](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/Choices/MacroChoice) will allow you to compound these two together into powerful chained workflows. Imagine pressing one hotkey to automatically create a new note to track a chess match with a specific template, while automatically adding a reference to it in your "list of matches" note and in your daily note.

[Multi choices](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/Choices/MultiChoice) are purely organisational: folders of other choices.

Throughout your choices, you can use the [QuickAdd format syntax](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/FormatSyntax), which is similar to the Obsidian template syntax. You could, for example, use ``{{DATE}}`` to insert the current date in a filename.
