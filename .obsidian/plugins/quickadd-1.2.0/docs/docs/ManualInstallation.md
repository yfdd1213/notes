title: Manual Installation
---

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd/releases) and download the ZIP file from the latest release. The one that looks like `quickadd-x.x.x.zip`.
2. This ZIP file should be extracted in your Obsidian plugins folder. If you don't know where that is, you can go to `Community Plugins` inside Obsidian. There is a folder icon on the right of `Installed Plugins`. Click that and it opens your plugins folder.
3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file there.
4. Now you should have a folder in plugins called 'quickadd' containing a `main.js` file, `manifest.json` file, and a `styles.css` file.
